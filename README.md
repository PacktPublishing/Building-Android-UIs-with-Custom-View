## About the Book
Free shipping on print orders for US, UK, Europe and selected Asian countries
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
<com.packt.rrafols.customview.OwnTextView
 android:layout_width="wrap_content"
 android:layout_height="wrap_content"
 android:text="Hello World!" />
```

In order to follow the examples in this book, you’ll need Android Studio installed. We’ll briefly cover how to install and set up a device emulator in the first chapter. It’s highly recommended to get at least Android Studio 3.0. At the time of writing this book, Android Studio 3.0 is still beta, but stable enough to develop, run, and test all the examples. In addition, our recommendation is to have an Android device to better experience user interactions in the custom views we’ll create, but they will also work in an Android emulator.
